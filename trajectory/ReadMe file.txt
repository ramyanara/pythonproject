For the vehilce trajectory project we initially began with Frame sepatration,Image detection and tracking of moving objects,
then we clubed all together and ended up with 2 files (each with the different implementations i.e one with drawing paths(track.py) and other with calculations of a vehicle's location(code.py))  namely,


track.py - optical flow in video (i.e) Draws the path of vehicles

code.py - co-ordinates(location i.e longitutde and latitude)of the vehicles along with time stamp is displayed in excel sheet (info.csv)



We executed the code in Pycharm with the installations of,
 
-numpy
-cv2
-imutils
